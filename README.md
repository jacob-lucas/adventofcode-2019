Solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) (In Progress)

Each year I try to learn a new programming language or a new aspect of a programming language I already know. This year, I'm trying to learn more about the [vavr](https://www.vavr.io/) library.

Solutions are presented in Java, built using Gradle.

# Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jacob-lucas/adventofcode-2019.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jacob-lucas/adventofcode-2019)

# Solutions
The solution for each day is in its own class under `/src/main/java/com/jacoblucas/adventofcode2019`. Each respective day has its own main method to run the solution for that day. 

The solutions for parts 1 and 2 for the day will be printed to stdout.
